## Build for Web
Run the following command to compile:
```shell
$ wasm-pack build --release --target web
```

Then add the `index.html` into the `pkg` folder:
```html
<html>

<head>
    <title>Bounce Up!</title>
</head>

<body>
    <script type="module">
        import init from "./bounce_up.js";
        init("./bounce_up_bg.wasm").then(function (wasm) {
            wasm.run();
        });
    </script>
</body>

</html>
```

Finally copy the `assets` folder into the `pkg` folder, pack and release.
